## Configuration
To use the TMDB API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Sign up for an account on https://www.themoviedb.org/ if you don't have one already.
2. Visit the API Settings page and create a new API key.
3. Copy the generated API key.
Once you have the API key, create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
```
Replace your-api-key-goes-here with your actual API key.

## Running the Website

```
npm run dev
```
or

```
yarn dev
```
Once the server is running, you can access the website in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Building for Production

```
npm run build
